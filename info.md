This is my current app (in react native):


```
A mobile-first time-tracking tool for logging and visualizing time spent on activities.
Upon launch, the interface presents a light-themed grid of pastel-colored, square task cards. Each card displays a centrally aligned icon, a task name, and a live-updating timer for activities such as "Study," "Personal Proj  ect," or "Client Work". A tap on a card starts or stops its timer; only one timer operates at any given time. The active task card is visually differentiated by an animation, and the inactive ones are dimmed.

A sticky header bar shows the current activity's name and icon, alongside a "Stop" button. New activities are created through an "Add" card, which transitions to an in-place form for inputting the activity name, selecting a color theme, and choosing an icon.

The user interface employs some soft gradients, minimal shadows, and animations.
```

I want you to help me plan, so I can implement a more polished product.



I like the plan, but also here are some things that just came to me:

- maybe it would be better if we have projects, and those projects have start dates and deadllines, and tasks (which is what we have now).
- maybe some tasks have types (?, like pomodoro for example?), so not just start stop but it has some special logic and functionalities.
- we should use AI/Agentic AI. AI, maybe a tutor (btw, this could pivot the idea positively)
Im just brainstorming (i like those ideas but not sure if exactly like that), I want you to help me on this.

important: be messy and willing to make mistakes and think big. disregard concerns about meeting your expected needs, share ideas even if they are incomplete, unpolished, or contradictory


Wait, lets keep brainstorming, for example this idea:
```
This 3-hour task equals one movie or four episodes of your favorite show
```
i want to comment, what if we have, like, a bank of activities, like watching shows or maybe procrastinating stuff, etc.
the thing is that there will be a currency (maybe with a funny name, maybe "flurbos" or something), and this currency will only be gain doing actual productivity stuff (in this case, tasks), but why is it called a bank? because users could do these activities, without having the coins, so they would be in debt, or something like that.
lets keep brainstorming
